> I’m always looking to identify those scenarios that aren’t easily accounted for that could cause an issue down the road. I love those ‘good catch’ moments.

**What do you do?**

I'm a Software Quality Assurance Tester.

**What led you to your current role?**

I have a degree in Management Information Systems. I originally studied engineering in college, but in my last year realized I had a greater passion for computer technology than engineering, and changed my Major. Once I graduated, I started an IT internship with a healthcare company that eventually led to a full-time position in Quality Assurance. I knew right away that this was perfect fit for me.

**What did you want to be growing up?**
Growing up I loved animals and wanted to be a veterinarian. I think I soon realized that although I love animals, I didn’t have the stomach for all that veterinary medicine would require.

**What is your first memory of being intrigued by technology?**

In high school I was interested in photography, and I remember vividly when one of my classmates showed me a digital camera, which was new at the time. I thought it was so cool that you could view and delete pictures before they were printed. At the time, the pictures were terrible and grainy, but the concept itself was what amazed me, and now film has become a thing of the past.

**Do you remember feeling encouraged or discouraged about going into technology?**

I was always encouraged by my parents to pursue something technical. When I was younger I was always interested in taking things apart and learning about how things went together. I excelled more in Math and Science, rather than subjects like History and Literature, so it was easy to see that was where my passions lied. I was told to find something I ‘liked’ to do, but at the same time I was also told be practical as far as finding something that would allow me to make a living.

**Have you had any mentors or champions along the way?**

Even though it was long before I started my career in IT, in high school I was the only female CAD Drafting student in my class. I had a drafting teacher that really encouraged me and made me feel that it was a positive thing to be interested in things that were maybe more male dominated at the time. Because of him I started an internship that not only gave me experience in CAD, but also opened the door to really learning about computers and technology.

**What has been your favorite project you've worked on?**

This past year I started working on a Customer Relationship Management tool. Because this was different than the types of applications that I had worked on in the past, I enjoyed the change and challenges that came along with it. The customer was consolidating their sales systems from many outdated databases into one sleek tool where all their data could be accessed. It was fun to watch the new application come together and the reaction of the Sales team to the end product.

This was also my first time working as part of an Agile – SCRUM Team which was new and fun experience.

**What are your favorite or most-used tools?**

I use YouTube so often for a reference tool. I taught myself to knit by watching tutorials, and when it came to learning more advanced techniques it’s always my go-to tool. Recently I have been working to train my dog, and have picked up so many useful tips and tricks from experienced trainers. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is even better!

**What do you want to learn next?**

I always love to learn new things and take on new challenges. As far as my technical skills I would love to learn more about Test Automation tools. It can be an excellent time saving tool for repetitive testing.

**What hobbies do you have that are unrelated to your current field?**

I love to cook, knit, ride motorcycles, and hike with my family.

**What motivates you?**

Feeling like I did the best job possible to deliver a quality product to my business customers.  I’m always looking to identify those scenarios that aren’t easily accounted for that could cause an issue down the road. I love those ‘good catch’ moments.  

**What advice do you have?**

Never be afraid to try something new. If there is something you want to do or try, give it a shot. It is far better to try and fail than never try at all.
